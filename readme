# Lab 1:
Get all the requirements for Cypress installed and write your first test!

## Requirements:
    Node.js version 12.10.*; Yarn version 1.17.3. (Tested versions.)
```
	Your exact versions will depend on your distribution and how you have installed them. For Ubuntu:

	$ # Install the latest nodejs, not the old version in the Ubuntu repos.
	$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
	$ sudo apt install -y nodejs libgconf-2-4
	$ node -v
	v12.10.0
	$ # Install the latest yarn, not the old version in the Ubuntu repos.
	$ curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	$ echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
	$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
	$ yarn -v
	1.17.3
```
Once Node and yarn are installed, clone this package, cd into cypress-workshop, then run the following:
```
yarn
```
Lastly, to verify your install run the following:
```
yarn run cypress
```
And you should see the Cypress runner open with the smoketest listed.
